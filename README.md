A Python-based Task Manager Application employing the
'Model-View-Controller' pattern 😁. It facilitates users to
effortlessly create, update, remove, or view tasks, deadlines,
priorities, and categories.

## Features ✨

1. Create a new task: Easily add new tasks to a database
2. Update a task: Modify existing tasks as needed
3. Remove a task: Delete tasks that are no longer relevant
4. View task(s): Dive into detailed information about specific tasks or get an overview of all tasks
5. View deadlines: Stay on top of your deadlines
6. View priorities: Prioritise tasks based on their importance
7. View categories: Organise tasks effortlessly into different categories

## Getting started ✅

Follow these simple steps to get started with the Task Manager Application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine <br />
   `git clone https://github.com/andyagdw/task_manager_app.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory <br />
   `cd task_manager_app`
3. Open Visual Studio Code <br />
   `code .`
4. Set up a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code terminal. Make sure you are in the project directory. <br />

   Using venv:

   `python -m venv venv` <br />
   For Python 3.3 or newer: <br />
   `python3 -m venv venv`

   Using virtualenv:

   ```
   pip install virtualenv
   virtualenv venv
   ```

5. Activate the virtual environment

   Using venv:

   Windows: <br />
   `venv\Scripts\activate` <br />
   Unix\Mac: <br />
   `source venv/bin/activate`

   Using virtualenv: <br />

   Windows: <br />
   `venv\Scripts\activate` <br />
   Unix\Mac: <br />
   `source venv/bin/activate`

6. Ensure project dependencies are installed: <br />

```
- flake8==7.0.0
- mccabe==0.7.0
- pycodestyle==2.11.1
- pyflakes==3.2.0
```

7. In the project directory, run the main script using: <br />
   `python src\main.py`

## Accessing the Database 📊

To delve into the database, I highly recommend utilising DB Browser for its exceptional quality and
user-friendly visual interface. Plus, its free! 

1. Download DB Browser: <br />
   If you haven't already, download and install [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/).

2. Open database with DB Browser: <br />
   Locate and open the database file using the 'Open Database' option in the File menu - it should be inside the project directory.

3. Explore the Database <br />
   Once the database is opened, you can browse through the tables and data using the intuitive interface of DB Browser 😁.

You're all set! Start managing your tasks efficiently with the Task Manager Application. 🚀
